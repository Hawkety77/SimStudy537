Generate data under three variance-covariance structures:
1) Compound Symmetric (\sigma^2_e, \sigma^2_s)
2) Random coefficients: ZGZ'+R (for intercepts and slopes)
3) AR(1)
det |CS| approx = |RC| approx = |AR(1)|

Two treatment groups, where each subject has 5 observations

Control: beta_0 + 0*x_i
Tmt: beta_0 + beta_1*x_i

Test the null hypothesis:
H_0: beta_1,control = beta_1,tmt at the alpha level

(Simulate about 1000 times)
1) Simulate data under null to estimate size
2) Simulate data under alternative hypothesis (just one)
3) Use F test and LRT

=====================================================================================

Use cholesky decomposition: V = CC'
Generate data that has covariance V=\sigma^2I => Var(CV) = CVar(V)C' = C\sigma^2IC' = \sigma^2CC'

Details:
Choose a covariance matrix $V$ for one subjectâ€™s repeated measures (size $5\times5$ since there are 5 observations per subject).

Compound symmetric (CS): all variances equal $\sigma^2$, all covariances $\rho\sigma^2$.

Random coefficients (RC): covariance implied by random intercept and slope, e.g.
$V = \sigma_b^2 1 1' + \sigma_c^2 x x' + \sigma_e^2 I$.

AR(1): $(V)_{ij} = \sigma^2\rho^{|i-j|}$.

Compute the Cholesky factorization
$V = C C'$,
where $C$ is lower-triangular.

Generate independent standard normal vectors
$z_i \sim N(0,I_5)$ for each subject.

Induce correlation:
$y_i = X_i\beta + C z_i$,
which ensures $\text{Var}(y_i) = C \text{Var}(z_i) C' = C I C' = V$.

Things to vary (still check the Ftest vs. LRT): (pick which combo we want to do)
1) Balanced vs. Unbalanced
2) Small n and large n

Write-up:
3 pages of writing, and 1 page of figures (he doesn't want to read it at all)
- Don't ever say "due to the fact that", just say because
- The word data is plural (the data are)
- Less and fewer (it's absolutely butchered in this country) --- it's an absolutely an abomination
    - There is less soil/sand
    - Fewer used with countable items
- Same with number (discrete)and amount (uncountable)
