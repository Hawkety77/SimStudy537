STAT 537 Simulation

Simulations for
Compound Symmetric
Random coefficients
AR (1)

Each subject among two test groups
Each subject will have 5 observations across time
CONTROL GROUP
- Beta0 + 0*x
TMT GROUP
- Beta0 + Beta1*x

Null hypothesis:
- Alpha level of H0: Beta1_control = Beta1_tmt
- You decide how big the Beta0s are
- But you test the Beta1s

Hints:
— may need to use cholesky decomposition
— first time through slopes should be 0
— second time through tmt slope will be big

TEST POWER AND ALPHA LEVELS using both F test and likelihood ratio test
Determinant of compound symmetric ~= Random coefficients determinant ~= AR 1 determinant
Choose either
- form of unbalanced and balanced data comparisons
- Form of small n and large n data comparisons
